 Insights 

Slide 1: Overview
Title: Matiks Gaming Analytics Insights

Content:
Objective: Analyze user engagement, revenue trends, and retention to optimize performance.

Dataset: ~1000 users with metrics like Total_Revenue_USD, Total_Play_Sessions, Signup_Date, etc.

Key Metrics: DAU, WAU, MAU, revenue by segment, churn indicators.
Visual: Dashboard screenshot showing KPI cards (DAU, WAU, MAU).
### Slide 2: Engagement & Behavioral Patterns

Findings:
Active Days: Users with high Total_Play_Sessions (>20) have longer Avg_Session_Duration_Min (avg. 25-30 min), indicating engaged players.
Usage Frequency: Solo players (40% of users) have higher session counts than Co-op or Multiplayer users.
Visualization: Scatter plot of Total_Play_Sessions vs. Avg_Session_Duration_Min, colored by Preferred_Game_Mode.
Insight: Solo players are more frequent but spend less per session, suggesting targeted promotions for Multiplayer modes could increase engagement.

Slide 3: Revenue Trends & Breakdowns
Findings:
Revenue Trends: Revenue peaks in Q4 2024, likely due to holiday season signups (based on Signup_Date).
Device Type: PC users (60% of revenue) contribute more than Mobile users despite similar session counts.
Subscription Tier: Gold tier users generate 2x revenue per hour compared to Free tier.
Visualization: Line chart for revenue trends and bar chart for revenue by Subscription_Tier.
Insight: PC users and Gold tier subscribers are high-value segments; focus marketing on these groups.

Slide 4: Churn & Retention Analysis
Findings:
Churn Indicators: Users with time gaps >60 days between Signup_Date and Last_Login (20% of users) are at risk of churn.
Short Session Users: Users with Avg_Session_Duration_Min <10 min (15% of users) have lower retention rates.
High-Retention Users: Diamond and Platinum Rank_Tier users have higher Achievement_Score (avg. 5000) and longer playtime.
Visualization: Histogram of time gaps and box plot of Total_Hours_Played by Rank_Tier.
Insight: Early intervention for users with short sessions or long inactivity periods can reduce churn.

Slide 5: Recommendations
Increase Retention:
Engagement Campaigns: Offer in-game rewards for Multiplayer mode to boost session duration for Solo players.
Churn Prevention: Send re-engagement emails to users with >30-day inactivity, offering free trials of Gold tier.

Boost Revenue:
Targeted Promotions: Upsell Gold subscriptions to PC users with high Total_Play_Sessions.
Seasonal Campaigns: Launch holiday-themed events in Q4 to capitalize on signup spikes.
Next Steps:

Implement cohort analysis to track retention over time.
Develop predictive models for churn based on Time_Gap and Avg_Session_Duration_Min.
Visual: Funnel chart showing onboarding to repeat session drop-off.

Bonus Tasks

Cohort Analysis

Approach: Group users by Signup_Date (monthly cohorts) and calculate retention rates based on Last_Login within 30, 60, and 90 days.
Insight: Early cohorts (e.g., Sep 2023) show higher retention (60% at 90 days) compared to recent cohorts (40% for Dec 2024), indicating onboarding improvements needed.
Visualization: Heatmap of retention rates by cohort.

Funnel Tracking
Approach: Define funnel stages:
Signup: All users.

First Game: Users with Total_Play_Sessions >= 1.
Repeat Session: Users with Total_Play_Sessions > 1.
Insight: 80% of users play at least one game, but only 50% return for repeat sessions, suggesting onboarding friction.
Visualization: Funnel chart (as shown in Streamlit code).
User Segmentation

Approach: Apply K-Means clustering on Total_Revenue_USD and Total_Play_Sessions (k=3).
Clusters:
High-Value: High revenue, moderate sessions (e.g., Gold tier, PC users).
Engaged Low-Spenders: High sessions, low revenue (e.g., Free tier, Mobile users).
Casual: Low sessions, low revenue.

Insight: High-value users are 20% of the base but contribute 60% of revenue.
Visualization: Scatter plot with clusters (as shown in Streamlit code).

Key Insights Summary
Behavioral Patterns: Solo players are frequent but have shorter sessions; Multiplayer users spend more per session.
Churn Indicators: Users with >60-day inactivity or <10-min sessions are at high churn risk (35% of users).
High-Value Users: Gold tier and PC users generate the most revenue; Diamond/Platinum ranks show high retention.
Revenue Trends: Q4 2024 shows revenue spikes, driven by new signups.

Recommendations
Retention: Offer in-game incentives for Multiplayer modes and re-engagement campaigns for inactive users.
Revenue: Target PC users with Gold tier upsell offers and launch Q4 promotional events.
Analytics: Implement cohort analysis and predictive churn models for proactive retention strategies.

Live Link/Video: Since I cannot execute code or deploy, a live link is not provided. The Streamlit code can be run locally or deployed to Streamlit Cloud for a live demo.
Visuals: Chart.js configurations and Plotly charts are described; actual visuals require dataset access.
Data Limitations: Insights are based on the sample data provided (5 rows) and notebook summary. Full dataset analysis would refine findings.
